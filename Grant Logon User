// After creating the user you must assign the opportunity to access the Database

// Solution:

1. alter user <created username> identified by <password>;

2. GRANT CREATE SESSION TO cor_fra;  // Now the new user can access the database;

// You can also grant system privileges with the admin option.

3. GRANT CREATE SESSION TO <created username> WITH ADMIN OPTION;
