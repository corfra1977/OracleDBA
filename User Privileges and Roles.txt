					--PRIVILEGES--

--There are over 100 distinct system privileges. Each system privilege allows a user to perform a particular database operation or class of database operations.

--If you grant a privilege to a user, then Oracle adds the privilege to the user's privilege domain. The user can immediately exercise the privilege.

--If you grant a privilege to PUBLIC, then Oracle adds the privilege to the privilege domains of each user. All users can immediately perform operations authorized by the privilege.

--When you grant a privilege on "ANY" object (for example, CREATE ANY CLUSTER), you give the user access to that type of object in all schemas, including the SYS schema. 
   In order to secure the data dictionary, ensure that the O7_DICTIONARY_ACCESSIBILITY initialization parameter is set to FALSE.
   When this parameter is not set to FALSE, the ANY privilege applies to the data dictionary, and a malicious user with ANY privilege could access or alter data dictionary tables.


//Granting a System Privilege to a User:

//To grant the CREATE SESSION system privilege to the sample user corfra, allowing corfra to log on to Oracle, issue the following statement:

	GRANT CREATE SESSION 
   		TO corfra;

//To grant the ALTER DATABASE system privilege to the sample user corfra

	GRANT ALTER DATABASE 
   		TO corfra;

					--ROLE--

--A role groups several privileges and roles, so that they can be granted to and revoked from users simultaneously. A role must be enabled for a user before it can be used by the user.

--Oracle Corporation recommends that you design your own roles for database security

//Granting Roles to a User:

	GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE, DBA 
		TO corfra;

//These roles are predefined Role(CONNECT, RESOURCE and DBA) 
//You can find here more Roles....https://docs.oracle.com/cd/A97630_01/server.920/a96540/statements_912a.htm#2063440
